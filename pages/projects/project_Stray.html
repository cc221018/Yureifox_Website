        <h3>Stray</h3>
        <p>Stray, short for Strategic Payment, is an online banking platform designed to provide users with a safe and intuitive experience in managing their 
            bank accounts. With both a website and app version, Stray emphasizes responsive design to accommodate users across various devices and locations. 
            The platform's design is inspired by the game “Stray”. This creates a playful and futuristic feel, recognizing the importance of an appealing and modern 
            interface for user comfort and satisfaction (and contributes to a fun experience for the designer :D).</p>

                    <h4>Setting up the Project</h4>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create an intuitive website and an app version of a finance platform, but based on something I like, whether 
                        its a book, movie, game or any other hobby. This would help me to apply a playful touch to my design without ruining the user experience. 
                        I chose the video game Stray for its futuristic look and started creating personas, the user flow and LoFi wireframes. After that, I built 
                        my design system consisting of atoms, molecules and organisms, step by step.</p>

                        aiming to not only simplify the user experience but also establish a welcoming atmosphere from the very start of their interaction with the platform.</p>

                        along with corresponding spendings and earnings details. Users can quickly grasp their financial activity during a specific period or by 
                        categories, ensuring a comprehensive overview at first glance.</p>

                        is mandatory for transaction completion, ensuring an additional layer of safety. Users retain the option to cancel the transaction if they feel uneasy. 
                        Extra confirmation screens provide clear feedback on the success or cancellation of the transaction, enhancing user comprehension of the process and 
                        system status.</p>
