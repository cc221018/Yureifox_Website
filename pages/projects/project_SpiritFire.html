        <h3>Spirit Fire</h3>
        <p>Spirit Fire is a small 2D browser game of the type “top down treasure hunter”, coded in Javascript. In this game, you play as a tiny Spirit Fox that needs 
            to dodge enemies, collect flames and sometimes solve a puzzle in order to complete a level. The finished product is a result of the 
            final 2 project weeks of my first semester, also known as the “Creative CodeLabs 1”.</p>

                    <h4>Pixelart & Spritesheets</h4>
                    <p>Before starting with the first few lines of code, I needed to create the graphics for the game. This meant making a lot of pixelart, 
                        including map tiles, objects and spritesheets for the animations.</p>

                    <h4>HTML/CSS Screens</h4>
                    <p>The home screen, as well as other screens like the pause and success/death screens, are crafted using straightforward HTML and CSS code. The home 
                        screen provides information on controls and the available biomes for gameplay. Each biome, such as the Forest and Mushroom biomes, consists 
                        of 10 levels, with the Forest covering levels 1-5 and the Mushroom biome spanning levels 6-10. The difficulty progressively increases with each level.</p>

                    <h4>The Levels</h4>
                    <p>The game levels are structured as 10x17 2D arrays with numbers from -1 to 6, representing game objects like walls, doors, keys, flames, wolves, 
                        and the player (fox). Object collisions are programmed to dictate player interactions, such as encountering a wall resulting in no action, or 
                        facing a wolf leading to a Game Over screen.</p>

                    <h4>Code Structure</h4>
                    <p>The code is mainly based on object-oriented principles, utilizing inheritance to share common functionalities and characteristics among 
                        game objects. A general object serves as a base class. The image object, built upon the general onject, handles the animation part of 
                        all the specific game objects that inherit it, like for example flames, walls, or wolves. Each file in my project directory encapsulates 
                        the behavior and attributes of its respective game object for organized and modular code.</p>
