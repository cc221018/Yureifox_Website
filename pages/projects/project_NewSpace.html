        <h3>NewSpace</h3>
        <p>Embarking on a mission to improve social meetups, this project focuses on creating a user-friendly app for marginalized or niche groups. 
            By incorporating inclusive features like a smooth onboarding process, chat and voice chat options, event creation, people discovery, and 
            location-based information, the app aims to provide a safe space for meaningful connections. The design prioritizes simplicity, intuitive 
            navigation, and engaging micro interactions, pushing the boundaries of conventional meetup app experiences.</p>

                    <h4>Setting up the Project</h4>
                    <p>Meetup apps can be crowded and overwhelming places - especially for members of marginalized or niche groups. So, I asked myself, 
                        how can I create a safe environment where someone belonging to such a demographic can truly connect with like-minded people? How can 
                        I make sure that the final prototype can help the user journey from start to end, in a logical way? <br>
                        In order to understand the user’s perspective, I created a persona and set up a simple user flow.</p>

                    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    <p>For this project, I opted for a unique approach by creating hand-drawn wireframes. Exploring this method provided a pleasant way to 
                        swiftly sketch down all my thoughts. Taking notes alongside the sketches proved invaluable in capturing even the smallest ideas, as they 
                        could potentially evolve into significant concepts. This process allowed me to gather and organize my thoughts effectively.</p>

                    <h4>Onboarding</h4>
                    <p>After I’ve had the main idea sketched down I was ready to dive into the HiFi designs. Since I love dark modes on apps and websites I decided 
                        to do the same with my meetup app. Choosing a dark purple as the main color was a very bold choice and it was hard to incorporate it well, but 
                        I think I eventually made it work. I started with creating the onboarding screens.</p>

                    <h4>The 3 Main Pages</h4>
                    <p>NewSpace has 3 main pages which you can get to through the navigation bar at the bottom: The Map, Chats, and Your Profile.</p>

                    <h4>The Interactive Map</h4>
                    <p>The Map screen is the core feature of NewSpace. Similar to Google Maps, users can freely navigate to explore various nearby events or users 
                        around their current location. To enhance user experience, two switches at the top allow them to filter and display either events or users 
                        exclusively. For targeted searches, the "Find" screen offers recommendations and a search bar.</p>

                    <h4>Event Pages</h4>
                    <p>Users are able to join events or create their own ones through the Map screen. By adding tags, the events get categorized and thus help users 
                        find events that correspond with their interests a lot quicker. When creating an own event, simple descriptions, input fields and buttons 
                        make up for an intuitive and logical user journey.</p>

                    <h4>Versatile Communication</h4>
                    <p>On the chats screen, the user’s most recent conversations with their friends can be seen. After opening a chat, whether it’s a 
                        group chat or not,  the user will be able to write a message or even start a voice/video call.</p>

                    <h4>Personalized User Profiles</h4>
                    <p>Similar to events, user profiles feature tags. Users can personalize their profiles by adding interests, making it simpler to find like-minded 
                        people. The lower section of a user profile provides useful information, showcasing events created or joined by that user. It even 
                        indicates whether an event is currently active or has taken place, aiding in discovering a friend's ongoing or hosted activities.</p>
