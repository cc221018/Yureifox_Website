        <h3>The Golden Fridge</h3>
        <p>The Golden Fridge, also known as TGF, is an Android app with a virtual fridge which enables users to organize their real fridge better, get an overview 
            of what’s currently inside, to plan meals in advance. Ultimately, the app aims to help users reduce their food waste and raise the awareness about the 
            global food waste problem. The finished product is a result of the final 2 project weeks of my third semester, also known as the “Creative CodeLabs 3” - 
            done in teams of 2 people.</p>

                    <h4>Setting up the Project</h4>
                    <p>The Creative CodeLabs (CCL) occur at the semester's end, requiring me to apply all the knowledge acquired throughout my courses to craft a 
                        final product. For this project, it meant donning the hats of a designer, user experience evaluater, (mobile) front-end and back-end developer, 
                        and user tester. Since there was only limited time to code, my project partner and me had to come up with a rather simple design for our app.</p>

                    <h4>Design Variants</h4>
                    <p>Simplicity wasn’t the only thing I wanted to incorporate into our app. I aimed to infuse it with an intuitive, fresh ambiance, given its focus 
                        on food. A touch of playfulness was also incorporated to inspire users to engage with the app more frequently. Our exploration with 
                        various colors led us to create multiple versions, allowing us to decide on which one fitted the most.</p>

                    <h4>The Fridge</h4>
                    <p>For our app, my partner and I wanted to create something simple, but intuitive and playful. We asked ourselves, how could we give a 
                        user the feel of actually organizing their own fridge? To achieve this, we introduced a virtual fridge as the main screen, featuring various 
                        categories of food. Users can easily add new items to any category, and for efficiency, we implemented color indicators to swiftly convey 
                        information, showing whether a category is empty, or an item is overdue.</p>

                    <h4>Informative Overview</h4>
                    <p>The second main screen serves as a comprehensive information hub. Most importantly and thus pinned at the top, it  highlights overdue 
                        items in the user's fridge to promote mindful consumption and reduce food waste. As users scroll down the Overview page, they 
                        encounter articles addressing diverse food waste topics, aiming to raise awareness and offer valuable knowledge and tips. The 
                        final section showcases a history of all items used up by the user, providing a comprehensive overview of their consumption patterns.</p>

                    <h4>User Testing</h4>
                    <p>Upon completing our designs, my project partner and I conducted usability testing, evaluating our app against 10 usability heuristics. 
                        This process enabled us to identify pain points and areas in need of further testing. Formulating experimental questions and 
                        hypotheses, we crafted a user test with 5 tasks and subsequently conducted it, involving 8 users. Through careful documentation 
                        and analysis of the results, we were able to vastly improve our app.</p>

                    <p>If you own an Android phone, feel free to scan this QR code and give TGF a try! Bare in mind that we had 2 weeks to fully design, code, 
                        and test our app, so if you find any mistakes, forgive us! <br> <br>
                        Upon testing TGF with this QR, there’s of course also the option of viewing the Figma designs and the code, both of which you can 
                        do at the top of this page.</p>
