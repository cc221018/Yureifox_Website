        <h3>ArtWay</h3>
        <p>ArtWay is a website which enables people to dive deeper into the world of art and gain and share valuable knowledge about the art industry and its 
            professional artists. In the end, it aims to helps young aspiring artists to have a much better chance at making a career as an artist or animator of 
            any category. The finished product is a result of the final 2 project weeks of my second semester, also known as the “Creative CodeLabs 2”.</p>

                    <h4>LoFi Designs</h4>
                    <p>The Creative CodeLabs (CCL) occur at the semester's end, requiring me to apply all the knowledge acquired throughout my courses to craft a 
                        final product. This entails donning the hats of a designer, front-end developer, and back-end developer. To manage time effectively, I 
                        streamlined the design phase, focusing solely on finalizing the LoFi prototype. Although a condensed approach, it laid a solid foundation for the project.</p>

                    <p>After finishing the LoFi wireframes, I delved into testing colors and crafting a logo. With a vision of creating a welcoming space for artists, 
                        the website was designed to exude an artistic touch. Employing vibrant, lighter colors to symbolize a bright future empowered by the platform felt 
                        like the perfect fit - I was ready to start the coding phase of my project.</p>

                    <h4>The 3 Main Pages</h4>
                    <p>ArtWay facilitates the swift retrieval of valuable information for young artists through three main pages: Insights, Artworks, and Artists. 
                        Each category serves as a dedicated space to streamline and organize information for a more efficient user experience: Artist profiles, 
                        their artworks and their insight posts. Similar to Tweets or blog posts, ArtWay’s Insights emphasize textual content over visuals. These 
                        posts, encompassing artists' comments, stories, and more, offer valuable tips and explanations on diverse topics within the art industry.</p>

                    <h4>Customizable User Profile</h4>
                    <p>On a user's - or artist's - profile, essential information such as country, status, and name is showcased. Two lists containing all 
                        their posts, including artworks and insight posts, are prominently displayed. Users have the flexibility to customize and edit both 
                        private and public information on their own profile page, ranging from profile picture, status, and posts to email and password. This 
                        allows for a personalized ArtWay experience tailored to individual preferences.</p>
