                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m  <b>Yureifox</b>,  but most people call me Samy. <br> <br>
                        I’m an Austria-based student who aspires to create a more appealing and empathetic online world.
                        I always try to understand the ‘why’ behind everything that I do, both in design and in life. I also like foxes.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What do I do?</h5>
                    <p>
                        In my various projects, I often take on the roles of UI/UX and front-end designer. Though, as a student, I get the exciting
                        opportunity to explore different aspects of the creative process. Whether it's evaluating user experiences, testing interfaces,
                        or delving into full-stack development, I've worn many hats and gained valuable insights. <br>
                        Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm a dedicated digital artist and, occasionally, a 2D animator. At home, my passion for creativity truly comes to life! 
                    </p>

                    <p>Throughout my whole life I have immersed myself in the world of art and design, exploring every avenue to cultivate my skills 
                        and unleash my creativity. However, finding the perfect path was a bit of a challenge for me - after all, there are so many different ways 
                        to incorporate art and design in one’s career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After experimenting with various career options, I eventually landed at UAS St.Pölten, where I discovered the ideal fit for my aspirations. 
                        Currently enrolled in Creative Computing, I'm delving into the diverse and exciting aspects of the creative computer world. 
                        From designing, evaluating and coding websites to envisioning tangible user interfaces and game concepts, this journey is expanding my knowledge 
                        in numerous creative dimensions.
